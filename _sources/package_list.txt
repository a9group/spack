  Versions for Symmetric, Non-symmetric, Standard or Generalized Problems.
  * Single and Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Versions for Standard
  or Generalized Problems. * Routines for Banded Matrices - Standard or
  Generalized Problems. * Routines for The Singular Value Decomposition. *
  Example driver routines that may be used as templates to implement
  numerous Shift-Invert strategies for all problem types, data types and
  precision. This project is a joint project between Debian, Octave and
  Scilab in order to provide a common and maintained version of arpack.
  Indeed, no single release has been published by Rice university for the
  last few years and since many software (Octave, Scilab, R, Matlab...)
  forked it and implemented their own modifications, arpack-ng aims to
  tackle this by providing a common repository and maintained versions.
  arpack-ng is replacing arpack almost everywhere.

Description:
  AutomaDeD (Automata-based Debugging for Dissimilar parallel tasks) is a
  tool for automatic diagnosis of performance and correctness problems in
  MPI applications. It creates control-flow models of each MPI process
  and, when a failure occurs, these models are leveraged to find the
  origin of problems automatically. MPI calls are intercepted (using
  wrappers) to create the models. When an MPI application hangs, AutomaDeD
  creates a progress-dependence graph that helps finding the process (or
  group of processes) that caused the hang.

  academic and commercial use. It has C++, C, Python and Java interfaces
  and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. OpenCV was
  designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-
  time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take
  advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take
  advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous
  compute platform. Adopted all around the world, OpenCV has more than 47
  thousand people of user community and estimated number of downloads
  exceeding 9 million. Usage ranges from interactive art, to mines
  inspection, stitching maps on the web or through advanced robotics.

  we provide an implementation of this interface in both a standard SMP
  context as well as the SST context. The qthreads API provides access to
  full/empty-bit (FEB) semantics, where every word of memory can be marked
  either full or empty, and a thread can wait for any word to attain
  either state.

Description:
  Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. A large
  part of Boost is provided as C++ template code which is resolved
  entirely at compile-time without linking. This package aims to provide
  the most useful subset of Boost libraries for template use among CRAN
  package. By placing these libraries in this package, we offer a more
  efficient distribution system for CRAN as replication of this code in
  the sources of other packages is avoided. As of release 1.60.0-2, the
  following Boost libraries are included: 'algorithm' 'any' 'bimap' 'bind'
  'circular_buffer' 'concept' 'config' 'container' 'date'_'time' 'detail'
  'dynamic_bitset' 'exception' 'filesystem' 'flyweight' 'foreach'

Description:
  Implementation of a function 'digest()' for the creation of hash digests
  of arbitrary R objects (using the md5, sha-1, sha-256, crc32, xxhash and
  murmurhash algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R language objects,
  as well as a function 'hmac()' to create hash-based message
  authentication code. The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC
  1321, the sha-1 and sha-256 algorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and
  FIPS-180-2, and the crc32 algorithm is described in
  ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. For md5,
  sha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone
  implementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code
  from the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron
  D. Gifford is used. For xxhash, the implementation by Yann Collet is
  used. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is used. Please
  note that this package is not meant to be deployed for cryptographic
  purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely tested) libraries such
  as OpenSSL should be used.

  require the evaluation of a function. Using foreach without side effects
  also facilitates executing the loop in parallel.

Description:
  Provides a high-level R interface to data files written using Unidata's

  easily. It is also easy to create new netCDF dimensions, variables, and
  files, in either version 3 or 4 format, and manipulate existing netCDF
  files. This package replaces the former ncdf package, which only worked
  with netcdf version 3 files. For various reasons the names of the
  functions have had to be changed from the names in the ncdf package. The
  old ncdf package is still available at the URL given below, if you need
  to have backward compatibility. It should be possible to have both the

  symmetric encryption; RSA for asymmetric (public key) encryption or EC
  for Diffie Hellman. High-level envelope functions combine RSA and AES
  for encrypting arbitrary sized data. Other utilities include key
  generators, hash functions (md5, sha1, sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a
  secure random number generator, and 'bignum' math methods for manually
  performing crypto calculations on large multibyte integers.

Description:

  library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers and
  related algorithms. It supports dense and sparse matrices on integer,
  floating point and complex numbers, decompositions of such matrices, and
  solutions of linear systems. Its performance on many algorithms is
  comparable with some of the best implementations based on 'Lapack' and
  level-3 'BLAS'. The 'RcppEigen' package includes the header files from
  the 'Eigen' C++ template library (currently version 3.2.8). Thus users
  do not need to install 'Eigen' itself in order to use 'RcppEigen'. Since
  version 3.1.1, 'Eigen' is licensed under the Mozilla Public License
  (version 2); earlier version were licensed under the GNU LGPL version 3
  or later. 'RcppEigen' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to 'Eigen') is
  licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'.

Description:
  This is a package that allows conversion to and from data in Javascript
  object notation (JSON) format. This allows R objects to be inserted into
  Javascript/ECMAScript/ActionScript code and allows R programmers to read
  and convert JSON content to R objects. This is an alternative to rjson
  package. Originally, that was too slow for converting large R objects to
  JSON and was not extensible. rjson's performance is now similar to this
  package, and perhaps slightly faster in some cases. This package uses
  methods and is readily extensible by defining methods for different
  classes, vectorized operations, and C code and callbacks to R functions
  for deserializing JSON objects to R. The two packages intentionally
  share the same basic interface. This package (RJSONIO) has many
  additional options to allow customizing the generation and processing of
  JSON content. This package uses libjson rather than implementing yet
  another JSON parser. The aim is to support other general projects by
  building on their work, providing feedback and benefit from their
  ongoing development.

  The C++ header files of the Stan project are provided by this package,
  but it contains no R code, vignettes, or function documentation. There
  is a shared object containing part of the CVODES library, but it is not
  accessible from R. StanHeaders is only useful for developers who want to
  utilize the LinkingTo directive of their package's DESCRIPTION file to
  build on the Stan library without incurring unnecessary dependencies.
  The Stan project develops a probabilistic programming language that
  implements full or approximate Bayesian statistical inference via Markov
  Chain Monte Carlo or variational methods and implements (optionally
  penalized) maximum likelihood estimation via optimization. The Stan
  library includes an advanced automatic differentiation scheme, templated
  statistical and linear algebra functions that can handle the
  automatically differentiable scalar types (and doubles, ints, etc.), and
  a parser for the Stan language. The 'rstan' package provides user-facing
  R functions to parse, compile, test, estimate, and analyze Stan models.

  R_, icu_

Description:
  Allows for fast, correct, consistent, portable, as well as convenient
  character string/text processing in every locale and any native
  encoding. Owing to the use of the ICU library, the package provides R
  users with platform-independent functions known to Java, Perl, Python,
  PHP, and Ruby programmers. Among available features there are: pattern
  searching (e.g., with ICU Java-like regular expressions or the Unicode
  Collation Algorithm), random string generation, case mapping, string
  transliteration, concatenation, Unicode normalization, date-time
  formatting and parsing, etc.
